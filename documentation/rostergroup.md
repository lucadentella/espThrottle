# JMRI roster groups

In JMRI, the list of known locos is called **Roster**. Each loco is a *Roster Entry*.
Using the **File** menu, in DecoderPro it is possible to Import/Export a single Entry or the entire Roster:

Roster entries can be grouped in **Roster Groups**.
First create a new Group (Settings -> **Create Roster Group**):

Then select the locos that will belong to that group (Settings -> **Roster Group Table Association**):

A loco can belong to multiple groups.
